        run: |
          # By default, this finds HealthHUB.API.sln in the root
          dotnet restore HealthHUB.API.sln

      # 5) Build the entire solution (no output folder; each project goes to its own bin/)
      - name: Build solution
        run: |
          dotnet build HealthHUB.API.sln --no-restore --configuration Release

      # 6) Run all unit tests in the solution

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          dotnet test HealthHUB.API.sln --no-build --verbosity normal

      # 7) Publish only the WebAPI project to a single "publish" folder
      #    â–¶ Replace the path if your .csproj is somewhere else, but according to your screenshot:
      #      HealthHUB.API/HealthHUB.API.csproj is correct.

        run: |
